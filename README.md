Clone the repo, navigate command prompt/terminal to the folder, or use VS code default terminal.

Install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

Run the command `npm start`, it will compile the scss files to one css and then launch nodemon server on port 3000.

Navigate to `localgost:3000` on your browser to see my amazing website.

If you want to check the eslint and stylelint all you have to do is run the command `npm test` and you will see no errors in the terminal.
